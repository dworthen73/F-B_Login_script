# F-B_Login_script I am a newbie PS user. I have several PS scripts I need to modify to make our life easier. The goal is to create a script that will: 
use a XML to config the icons, 
extract the software installed-if there is a change from the base SDC-, 
extract and report the laptop and monitors(if possible) serial number
one button 'push me' to reconnect the users share drives and printers
one button OneDrive on/off switch (some sort of loop?...not sure what to choose as a trigger)
One Script to Bind Them in the the users dimness
